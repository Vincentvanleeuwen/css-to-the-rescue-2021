# CSS to the Rescue @cmda-minor-web 2020 - 2021

## Assignment

For the restaurant Russ & Daughters I'm creating an interactive order page. Here you can order an egg and a toast. You can also add ingredients to the egg and the toast. It'll contain a lot of animation.

There as little as possible use of classes and id's, only for SVG practises I will make exceptions.
I will not be using circles, squares, rectangles and triangles in this project.
I will be looking at trying to reduce the motion of animations when reduced motion is turned on.
I will change the colors of the website when darkmode is turned on.
At last I will also add SVG's, SVG Masks and SVG Filters.

## CSS Techniques used
- CSS Variables
- Grid
- Flexbox
- Transform3D
- @font-face
- @keyframes
- Clamp()
- Responsive units (em, rem, %, vw, vh)
